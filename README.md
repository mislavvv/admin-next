## Proof of concepts on admin

### react 18 admin / react 18 admin-next

- (this) admin-next branch name: `master`
- admin branch name: `admin-next-testing-react18`
- "working version"
- some pages are not loading(?)
- admin is running slower(?)

### React 17 admin / react 18 admin-next

- (this) admin-next branch name: `inject`
- admin branch name: `admin-next-testing-inject`
- admin-next exports inject function which will be mounted to an admin html element, which allows us to use multiple react version, thus acting as if we were to import a for example vue component into react

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
